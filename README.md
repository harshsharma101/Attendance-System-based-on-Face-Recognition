# Attendance-System-based-on-Face-Recognition
 This is a system for monitoring attendance system which is based on face recognition technology. Later on I'll add the sentiment analysis part also in this project.

### Steps to run this project:-
- Run the app.py file
- Click on the link generated in the output section (http://127.0.0.1:5000)
- As it is a fresh run, we can see 0 users in the database.
- Add a face/user.
- Give a name, id and it'll capture 50 images. 
- Now we can see that now, the number of users in our database becomes 1.
- Similarly you can add as many users as you want.
- Now Let's start taking attendance by clicking on take attendance.
- As we can see, the names and userid are being shown on the frame.
- As soon as you close this window by hitting the 'q' key the attendance will show in the today's attendance section.
- Your attendance which contains name, id, and time will be there.
- So in this way, we can use this project.
- Also one thing, you can check the faces you've captured in the static folder. 
- And one CSV file will be automatically generated after taking the attendance  with the person's name, id, and time.

Thank you!
